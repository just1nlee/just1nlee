Nice to meet you! I'm a third year student at Oregon State University studying Computer Science, interested in backend development and cloud engineering. I'm currently working as a software developer for the Linux Foundation on the <a href="https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/">LFX platform</a>, and I've also earned my AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate and Cloud Practitioner certifications. I've built some cool personal projects like <a href="https://github.com/just1nlee/universeterminal">universeterminal</a> and <a href="https://github.com/just1nlee/pktpath">pktpath</a>, feel free to check them out if you have time. Thanks for stopping by!
